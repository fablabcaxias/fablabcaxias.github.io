<p><strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> is a <strong>Digital Fabrication</strong> program directed by <strong>Neil Gershenfeld</strong> of <strong><a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course</a></strong>, <strong>MAS 863</strong>: <strong>How to Make (Almost) Anything</strong>.</p><br>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> offers a <strong>6 month program on digital fabrication</strong>, and it could be taken in any of the participating labs. The <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> offers <strong>Certificates</strong> on relevant technical topics, and a <strong>Diploma</strong> aimed at vocational and technical training for employment and investment (along with assistance to its graduates in those areas). <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a> Certificates</strong> provide familiarity with technical options and capabilities, hands-on experience, and direction for further study. Each requires, and is evaluated by, developing and documenting projects. They are periodically renewed to reflect best practices. Each Certificate typically requires one week. They are combined in the Diploma, which is roughly comparable to completing MIT’s rapid-prototyping course <strong>‘How To Make (almost) Anything’</strong>. Progress is evaluated by skills and projects rather than time or credits.</p><br>
<p><strong>During this 6 month program, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.</strong></p><br>
