title: Fab Textiles - Dresselate
meta: Dressellate explores folding techniques by transforming a 2D pattern and a piece of fabric, into a 3D volume. The prototype, made from thin plastic sheets is a study of the volumetry of the body. The final piece is a double sided organic fabric covered with a natural resin that provides rigidness.

###DRESSELATE



Dressellate explores folding techniques by transforming a 2D pattern and a piece of fabric, into a 3D volume. The prototype, made from thin plastic sheets is a study of the volumetry of the body. The final piece is a double sided organic fabric covered with a natural resin that provides rigidness.



Concept: The digital pattern applied to the fabric attributes properties that are considered the basic tool of design. Different volumes of folding are shaped around the body.
