        <p><strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> is an intensive six month program that teaches students to design, prototype and invent almost anything using digital fabrication tools and machines.<br/><br/>The course is directed by <strong>Neil Gershenfeld</strong> from <strong><a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms</a></strong> and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course: How to Make (Almost) Anything. Since 2001, they have been at the cutting edge of the global maker movement; enabling innovation and democratising the use of digital fabrication technology through the growing network of Fab Labs around the world.</p>

            <br/>

            <p style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><em>“Digital fabrication consists of much more than 3-d printing. It is an evolving suite of capabilities to turn data into things and things into data. Many years of research remain to complete this vision, but the revolution is already well under way.”<br/>Neil Gershenfeld</em></p>

            <br/>

            <p>The Fab Academy brings together a multi-disciplinary and hands-on learning experience that can be taken in any number of participating Fab Labs around the world. At it’s core, Fab Academy empowers students to learn by doing, inspires them to make stuff locally, and to become active participants in sustainable cities and communities.</p>

<!-- ORIGINAL TEXT BELOW

<p><strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> is a <strong>Digital Fabrication</strong> program directed by <strong>Neil Gershenfeld</strong> of <strong><a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course</a></strong>, <strong>MAS 863</strong>: <strong>How to Make (Almost) Anything</strong>.</p><br>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> offers a <strong>6 month program on digital fabrication</strong>, and it could be taken in any of the participating labs. The <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> offers <strong>Certificates</strong> on relevant technical topics, and a <strong>Diploma</strong> aimed at vocational and technical training for employment and investment (along with assistance to its graduates in those areas). <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a> Certificates</strong> provide familiarity with technical options and capabilities, hands-on experience, and direction for further study. Each requires, and is evaluated by, developing and documenting projects. They are periodically renewed to reflect best practices. Each Certificate typically requires one week. They are combined in the Diploma, which is roughly comparable to completing MIT’s rapid-prototyping course <strong>‘How To Make (almost) Anything’</strong>. Progress is evaluated by skills and projects rather than time or credits.</p><br>
<p><strong>During this 6 month program, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.</strong></p><br>

	    <p>Fab Academy offers a unique and collaborative learning experience. The Fab Lab provides the space, inventory and machines for students to pursue their own project goals while participating in an interactive global classroom where they can share their progress, ideas, problems and solutions. Fab Academy teaches a <strong>“learning to learn”</strong> approach, where students share methods and best practices in an open-source and collaborative environment.</p> 
            
            <br/>
            
        <p>Students are supported by <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/about_us.html" target="blank">local instructors</a></strong> who guide students in the various assignments and topics covered. Every week is introduced via an <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/201139985" target="blank">interactive video stream</a></strong> guided by Neil Gershenfeld, where students share their progress, ask questions and receive feedback. The course is complimented by a series of <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/207127508" target="blank">live recitations</a></strong> each week from experts and professionals from various fields, all who are using digital fabrication to innovate in new and exciting ways.</p>
        
            <br/>
            
        <p>The course is divided into a <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/about/diploma/" target="blank">20 week program</a></strong>, with each week or two covering a different technology and skill. There is no global accreditation for these skills. Instead, <strong>each student builds an individual web portfolio to document their progress</strong>, trials and errors; integrating what they have learnt into a final project that gets evaluated together with their overall progress in the course.</p>

<p><strong>Each lab that participates in the Fab Academy program is part of a global Fab Lab / Fab Academy network</strong>. The local branches of the <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> work with other participating Fab Labs and experts from around the wold via a distributed educational model in which we pool our knowledge to provide a unique educational experience.</p><br>
<p>We watch and participate in global lectures broadcasted from <strong><a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">MIT</a> on Wednesdays at 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EST</strong>. The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester. In addition to the lectures, there are two lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects.</p><br>

<p><strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> faculty who are leading professionals in their respective fields provide global video lectures, supervise academic content, and guide research. Hands-on instruction in the labs is provided by instructors who supervise and evaluate Certificates, develop and disseminate instructional material, and assist with projects.</p><br>
